# dotfiles
for keeping dotfiles synced across devices. 
mostly stolen from other peoples configs, aren't I sneaky ;)

### Config files
- Config files include .xinitrc, bspwm, sxhkd, polybar and twmn current config. This is mostly for my own use, many links are hardcoded for my machines but feel free to take whatever you want ;) 
Oh, and I run these on gentoo, but should work on most linux distros
